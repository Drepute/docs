# The How

## How does rep3 fix this?

Communities can use the rep3 protocol to give badges to their members. These can be used for anythingâ€”to represent membership in the community, acknowledgment for a task well done, or, simply, a token of appreciation for active involvement.

By giving these badges, communities unlock deep insights into their people. This insight opens the door to better governance, improved community engagement, novel compensation schemes and much more.

Similarly, by receiving these badges, contributors build their on-chain reputation. This on-chain reputation makes possible a world of cheaper loans (by staking reputation), fairer voting (through correlation scores), deeper connections (by activating communities at varied intersections) and much more.
