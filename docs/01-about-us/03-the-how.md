# The How

## How does rep3 fix this?

rep3 lets communities give dynamic, upgradable NFTs to their members. These NFTs could represent their membership in the community, an acknowledgment for a task well done, or, simply, a token of appreciation for active involvement.

By giving these badges, communities add visibility to their members' work. This opens the door to better governance, improved community engagement, novel compensation schemes and much more.

Similarly, by receiving these badges, contributors build their on-chain reputation. This on-chain reputation makes possible a world of cheaper loans (by reputation staking), fairer voting (through correlation scores), deeper connections (by activating communities at varied intersections) and much more.
