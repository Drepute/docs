# The What

## What is rep3?!

rep3 is a project by DAO contributors, for DAOs and contributors. We're a protocol that does credentialing for communities.

In a nutshell, communities can increase member involvement and reduce operational overhead by using rep3's credentialing infrastructure (either by natively integrating the protocol via SDK or by using the [platform](https://app.rep3/gg/) we built atop the protocol).

We simply want to bridge the gap between communities and their members.
