# Setup and Approval
Setting up and approving custom badges is very similar to setting up and approving membership badges.

#### 1. Enable custom badges from the admin dashboard and add badge details.

#### 2. Mint them!
Approve the badges to be minted once members claim them.

>Note: Custom badges can only be distributed by the admins. Members cannot raise requests to receive custom badges.
