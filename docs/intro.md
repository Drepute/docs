## What You'll Find Here

The documentation page is designed to introduce rep3 and its products to users and developers of all skill levels. There are three main sections, with each giving a brief overview of the protocol, the tool and the Discord bot respectively.

Feel free to slide by our [Discord](discord.gg/xK2WXUv3VG) or our [Twitter](https"//twitter.com/rep3gg/") in case of queries or if you'd like to know more!
