# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!


This documentation is designed to introduce rep3 and its products to users and developers of all skill levels. There are roughly five sections to this documentation: the first two give a brief overview of rep3 and the protocol architecture, and the next three give a walkthough of the rep3 platform.

Feel free to slide by our [Discord](https://discord.gg/xK2WXUv3VG) or our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rep3gg/") in case of any queries or if you'd like to know more!
