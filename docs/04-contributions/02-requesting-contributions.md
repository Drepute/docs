# Requesting Contributions

After we have enabled contribution badges, we can invite our community members to create contribution requests against open tasks (or even if they have done work outside of the open tasks). 

Once in the contributor view, contributor's should **select the `+` button** in the top-right quadrant of the screen and **fill the contribution request form**. Then, they simply need to **select the `Request badge` button** and their contribution request is complete.

Now, the community admins / approvers must review the contribution requests and approve them so the members can claim their contribution badges. Let's look at the approval process.
