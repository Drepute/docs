# Approving Contributions

Approving contributions is one of the easiest things to do in rep3. Instead of manually tracking contributions, contributor's addresses, work links, etc., now you can see the details of all contributions neatly in one place.

You just need to **switch to the `Request` tab** on the top, **select a contribution request** from the pending requests, **mint the badge** and **approve the transaction**.

A good workflow is to have admins check the contribution requests regularly (say once a week or once every two days) so that your contributors receive their badges timely.
