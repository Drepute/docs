# Setting Up Contributions
What users (especially community admins and mods) appreciate the most about rep3 is how it has eradicated a lot of their manual flows. 

Earlier, to manage contributions and payouts, community admin or mods had to manually keep track of memberâ€™s addresses, their submissions, whether or not these were approved, and then sharing these with internal stakeholders, etc. Members, on the other hand, were left clueless after they made a submission, and frequent follow-ups soon became a chore. Well, not anymore! rep3 makes life easier for all.

After communities setup their contribution badges, members can simply make contribution requests by filling these forms see their contributions in one place. The admins can, on the other hand, can similarly see all contributions and easily approve or reject in a few clicks.

To setup contribution badges, we need to **enable these badges by selecting the `Enable Badges` button** and then **edit the contribution request** form if required. After doing this, **select the `Review Details` button**, and we're set!

Now you can invite your community to create contribution requests. The next section covers creating contribution requests in the contributor view.
