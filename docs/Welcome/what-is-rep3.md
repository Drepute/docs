# What is rep3?

At the heart of the rep3 protocol is the functionality that lets communities manage their members effectively. This is enabled by our membership badges, which is often the first badge issued by communities to their members. When these members receive membership badges, it makes them eligible to receive contribution, participation or appreciation badges, which act as proofs of their work and officialise their contributions to the community.

The protocol keeps track of all the secondary badges by making them children of the parent, membership badge.
