# Why rep3?

We can all agree that joining a community or contributing to a DAO is not the easiest thing in practice, especially when we consider how easy it is to get on-boarded in web2 organizations and start contributing to them. It is tempting now—in light of this comparison—to concede and say that web2 organizations are superior to web3 organizations—but this would simply be jumping the gun.

The true difference between web2 and web3 organisations is that the former has been around for longer, and therefore, has been able to develop systems of engagement that work better for them. 

Given the primitives of decentralisation and community ownership, if we too embrace these systems of engagement in web3, we shall also be able to deliver results that surpass the organisations that have come before us. 

Therefore the problems with DAOs do not lie in ideological differences, but rather differences in the systems of coordination. This is something rep3 aims to change.

By building the web3 primitives of society, we aim to spark a Cambrian explosion of innovation, and unlock the immense value stored in non-financial applications of web3 and crypto.
