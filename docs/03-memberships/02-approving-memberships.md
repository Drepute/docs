# Setting Up Memberships
Setting up memberships is a two-step process. First, we need to add the membership levels and the badge assets, and then we need to distribute these to our members. 

#### 1. Setup membership badges.
Add the membership levels and upload the badge designs. These could be .jpgs, .pngs and even .gifs, and the levels and assets can be edited later as well.

#### 2. Distribute them!
Now select the Mint badges button, and simply add the addresses of the people in your community. In the example below, we are giving Core membership badges to members with addresses 0xb… and 0xE…. Like this, we can mint membership badges to any number of addresses for each membership level. 
Bulk uploads via .csv are supported as well!

Now you just need to invite your community members so they can claim their membership badges. Do so by selecting the `copy invite link` button and sharing it with your members on your communication platform of choice.

 Next, let's take a look at how your community member's shall claim their badges.
