# Updating Memberships

One of the most celebrated features of rep3 is how communities can dynamically capture the journey of their members. By being able to update membership levels, communities can, for example, incentivise regular contribution (by “levelling up” members) and disincentive extended, uninformed absence (by “levelling down” members).

As a community admin, updating membership levels is done in just a few steps.
