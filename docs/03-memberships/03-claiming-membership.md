# Claiming Membership

After you have created membership badges and invited your members to the rep3 platform, they shall be able to claim their membership badges in a few clicks. They just need to **select the `Claim Badge` button, and sign the transaction**.

After signing the transaction and waiting for about 10-15 seconds, the membership badge gets minted to their address! They can now select the buttons in the bottom-right of the pop-up to view their badge on Etherscan or on OpenSea.

>Note: that the actual minting process is only triggered *after* the member selects the `Claim Badge` button. This ensures that members always have full control over what gets minted to their address. 

Admins / approvers can also upgrade or downgrade the membership level of a member. This is what the next section covers.
